# Bresenham---circle--pattern
Patterns created using Bresenham's Circle Algorithm.

This project demonstrates two unique circle patterns generated using the Bresenham's Circle Algorithm in Java.
The algorithm ensures efficient and precise circle drawing by using only integer calculations, making it suitable for computer graphics applications.
